# Simple-Linear-Regression

This notebook implements a simple linear regression model using Python's popular data analysis and machine learning libraries, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. It demonstrates the basic principles of linear regression, where the goal is to fit a linear equation to a set of data points in order to predict future values.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: It starts by importing and cleaning the data to ensure it’s ready for model training.
- **Model Training**: The notebook demonstrates how to apply the simple linear regression model to a dataset.
- **Visualization**: It includes data visualization using `matplotlib`, providing clear insights into the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
- **Prediction**: Once the model is trained, it makes predictions on new data based on the fitted linear model.
- **Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using key metrics, such as the coefficient of determination (R²).

This notebook is ideal for those looking to understand and apply basic machine learning techniques in Python, especially for regression tasks.
